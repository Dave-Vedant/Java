/*
Good Code Practice:

Why generic: in list type if we do not declare data type then, in case of error we only know at compile time, and during
coding time, we just not get the concern , so QA analyst need to solve it, require more time and manpower, which is costly
,so its better to work with pre concerned method, is called Generic method.
